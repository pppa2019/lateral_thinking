Both women are white; the one whose house this takes place in is single.  A black friend of the other woman, the one who goes into the bathroom, was recently killed, reportedly by the KKK.  The woman who goes into the bathroom discovers a bloodstained KKK robe in the other's laundry hamper, picks up a nail file from the medicine cabinet (or some other impromptu weapon), and goes out and kills the other.
