The sole survivor of a shipwreck reached a desert isle. Unfortunately, he was blind.  Luckily, there was a freshwater spring on the island, and he rigged the ship's bell (which had drifted to the island also) at the spring's location.  The bell rang in the wind, directing him to water.  When he was becalmed for a week, he could not find water again, and so he died of thirst.
