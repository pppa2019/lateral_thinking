Hans and Fritz do everything right up until they're filling out a personal-information form and have to write down their birthdays. Fritz' birthday is, say, July 7, so he writes down 7/7/15.  Hans, however, was born on, say, June 20, so he writes down 20/6/18 instead of what an American would write, 6/20/18.  Note that this is only a problem because they *claim* to be returning Americans; there are lots of other nations which use the same date ordering.
