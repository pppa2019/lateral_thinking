A married couple was speeding into town when their sedan ran out of gas.  The man went for help after making sure his wife closed the windows and locked the doors of the car.  Upon his return, he found his wife dead and a stranger in the car.  The windows were still closed, the doors were still locked, and no damage was done to the car.  (SP, from _The Next Book of OMNI Games_; earlier from _How Come?_) How could this be?
