The man used to be blind; he's now returning from an eye operation which restored his sight.  He's spent all his money on the operation, so when the train (which has no internal lighting) goes through a tunnel he at first thinks he's gone blind again and almost decides to kill himself.  Fortunately, the light of the cigarettes people are smoking convinces him that he can still see.
