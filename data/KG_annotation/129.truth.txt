The two men were bungee jumpers.  They found a secluded wooden bridge and decided to bungee off of it.  One man jumped off after being tied to  the bridge, but at the nadir of his fall, the bridge gave out.  The man who jumped landed on the ground safely since he was fairly close to the earth, but the collapsing bridge fell on top of him.  The other man fell along with the bridge to his death.
