The poor man is hired by Aladdin to clean his palace.  Aladdin only wants the man to clean part of the palace because he does not wish anyone to enter his bedroom, where he keeps the magic lamp.  The poor man meticulously scrubs the palace from head to toe, and rubs the magic lamp in the process.  The djinn appears; the poor man wishes for riches, and no longer needs the job.
