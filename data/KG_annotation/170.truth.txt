The shopkeeper is a French baker.  An American tourist walks into the bakery, pauses to look up/remember the word for "bread" in French, which is spelled "pain."  The American says the word as if it were the English word "pain".  At first the shopkeeper does not understand what the American is saying.  When he does, he gets annoyed with the person's horrible pronunciation.
