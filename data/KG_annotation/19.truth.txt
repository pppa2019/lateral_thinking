You're a diver, going past a window of a sunken submarine (or ship).  The two men were in a sinking vessel; they had a gun but only one bullet.  Neither wanted to drown, so they played cards to see who would get the bullet.  The loser shot the winner (or else the winner shot himself), and then the loser drowned when the room filled up with water.
