There were two keen sportsmen. One evening at 6 p.m. one started walking at 4 miles per hour and the other started cycling at 12 miles per hour. After an hour each of them stopped. They then each ran for fifteen minutes at 8 miles per hour. They both started from the same place, A. They both kept heading in the same direction throughout and never changed course or rested during the entire 45 minutes. They both arrived at point B at the same time. How could this be and how far was it from A to B?
