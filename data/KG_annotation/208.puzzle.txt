A small plane was flying from Albany to New York some years ago. Seated beside each other were a grumpy old man smoking a foul pipe and a grumpy old lady with a noisy pet duck on her lap. Each spent most of the journey complaining about the other. Finally a compromise was reached. The old man agreed to throw his pipe out of the window if the old lady would throw her duck out. This was done. Just as the plane was about to land, the lady was pleased to see the duck flying alongside the plane. What did the duck have in its mouth?
