A woman who was driving on her own pulled into a filling station and bought some gasoline. As she drove off she noticed a stranger in a car following her. She tried to shake him o by turning, accelerating, slowing down, etc. Finally she turned into a police station, but she was shocked to see him follow her in. He was not a policeman and there were no mechanical faults with her car. Why did he follow her?
