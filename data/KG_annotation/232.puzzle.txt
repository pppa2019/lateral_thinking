Chuck was an American on holiday in Ireland. His rental car broke down while he was in a little village and he was able to pull into a garage. There he asked how he could find someone to drive him back to Dublin. The man at the garage said, haven't been here long but I am sure that Milligan is your man. He lives in the big white house at the end of the village/'	Chuck went up to the house and Milligan answered the door. "Can you drive me to Dublin?,/ asked Chuck. "No," answered Milligan and explained that in his old car he never drove outside the vicinity. However, as it was late he offered Chuck a room for the night. When Chuck awoke the next morning, he was shocked to see a huge golden eagle on the top of his wardrobe gazing down at him. Why did the man at the garage direct Chuck to Milligan?
