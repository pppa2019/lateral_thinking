Let's say "she" is named Suzy, and "they" are named Harry and Jane.  Harry is an elderly archaeologist who has found a very old skeleton, which he's dubbed "Jane" (a la "Lucy").  Suzy is a buyer for a museum; she's supposed to make some sort of purchase from Harry, so she invites him to have a business dinner with her (at a restaurant).  When she calls to invite him, he keeps talking about "Jane," so Suzy assumes that Jane is his wife and says to bring her along.  Harry, offended, calls Suzy's boss and complains; since Suzy should've known who Jane was, she gets fired.
