There is a poisonous spider in the toe of his shoe.  The last things he puts on are his shoes.  He gets bitten, feels ill, lies down on his bed, and then dies of the poison.  (It's a particularly poisonous spider, like the Australian Funnel-Web, whose bite can kill an adult human in 5 minutes, or the brown recluse, which I gather is also pretty deadly.)
