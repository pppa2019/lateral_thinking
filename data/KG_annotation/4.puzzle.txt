A man lives on the twelfth floor of an apartment building.  Every morning he takes the elevator down to the lobby and leaves the building.  In the evening, he gets into the elevator, and, if there is someone else in the elevator or if it was raining that day he goes back to his floor directly.  However, if there is nobody else in the elevator and it hasn't rained, he goes to the tenth floor and walks up two flights of stairs to his room. Why?
