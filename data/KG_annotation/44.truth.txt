The two men were working in a small room protected by a carbon dioxide gas fire extinguisher system, when a fire broke out in an adjoining room.  One of the men ran through the fire and escaped with only minor burns.  The other one stayed in the room until the fire extinguishers kicked in, and died of oxygen starvation.
