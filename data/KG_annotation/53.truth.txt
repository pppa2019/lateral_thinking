The man was blind. Elevators use buttons that work electrically through the skin. The button is activated at the slightest touch, making the elevator to run. He got into the elevator on his first day, wearing gloves. Therefore, men must remove gloves to make the buttons work. But on the first day he found that when he found the tenth floor with his ungloved hand stroking the buttons, all the buttons were activated and the elevator stopped on all floors. So since then, he has carried gloves with him. When he entered the elevator, he put it on, found the right button with his gloved hand, and pressed the button on the tenth floor with his ungloved hand.
