A man was shot during a robbery in his store one night.  He staggered into the back room, where the telephone was, and called home, dialing by feel since he hadn't turned on the light.  Once the call went through he gasped, "I'm at the store.  I've been shot.  Help!" or words to that effect.  He set the phone down to await help, but none came; he'd treated the telephone pushbuttons like cash register numbers, when the arrangements of the numbers are upside down reflections of each other.  The stranger he'd dialed had no way to know where "the store" was.
