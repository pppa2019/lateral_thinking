Abel is a prince of the island nation that he landed on.  A cruel and warlike prince, he waged many land and naval battles along with his father the king.  In one naval encounter, their ship sank, the king died, and the prince swam to a deserted island where he spent several months building a raft or small boat.  In the meantime, a regent was appointed to the island nation, and he brought peace and prosperity.  When Prince Abel returned to his kingdom, Cain (a native fisherman) realized that the peace of the land would only be maintained if Abel did not reascend to his throne, and killed the prince (with a piece of driftwood or some other impromptu weapon).
