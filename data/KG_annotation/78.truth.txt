Several men were shipwrecked together.  They agreed to survive by eating each other a piece at a time.  Each of them in turn gave up an arm, but before they got to the last man, they were rescued.  They all demanded that the last man live up to his end of the deal.  Instead, he killed a bum and sent the bum's arm to the others in a box to "prove" that he had fulfilled the bargain.  Later, one of them sees him on the subway, holding onto an overhead ring with the arm he supposedly cut off; the other realizes that the last man cheated, and kills him.
