The pharmacist gives the man a cup of coffee to drink while he's waiting.  After the man has drunk the coffee, the pharmacist says, "There was poison in that coffee.  I'll give you the antidote if you write a signed statement that you were planning to kill your wife.  I'll keep the confession; if anything happens to your wife, I'll give it to the police."
